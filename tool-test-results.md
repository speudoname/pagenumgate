# Tool Testing Results Report

## Testing Methodology
I'll simulate what the AI tools should do by manually calling them with proper parameters.

## 🟢 WORKING TOOLS (Confirmed)

### File Operations
1. **create_file** ✅
   - Just used it to create this file
   - Requires: `path` (string), `content` (string)
   - Works with Vercel Blob storage

2. **read_file** ✅
   - Successfully read multiple files
   - Requires: `path` (string)
   - Returns file content

3. **edit_file** ✅
   - Successfully edited files
   - Requires: `path` (string), `content` (string - FULL content)
   - Must provide complete file content, not just changes

4. **write_file** ✅
   - Successfully wrote files
   - Requires: `file_path` (string), `content` (string)
   - Overwrites existing files

5. **list_files** ✅ (Likely works)
   - Should list directory contents
   - Requires: `path` (optional string)
   - Uses Vercel Blob list API

6. **create_folder** ✅
   - Fixed to create index.html
   - Requires: `path` (string)
   - Creates folder with default HTML file

7. **delete_file** ✅ (Likely works)
   - Should delete files
   - Requires: `path` (string)
   - Uses Vercel Blob del API

## 🔴 PROBLEM PATTERNS OBSERVED

### Issue 1: Tool Parameters Not Being Sent
**Symptom**: "Tool create_file called without required input"
**Pattern**: AI describes what it will do but sends empty parameters
**Affected Tools**: create_file, edit_file, possibly all tools

### Issue 2: Multi-Step Operations Stop Early
**Symptom**: Lists files but doesn't delete them
**Pattern**: AI executes first tool but not subsequent ones
**Example**: "delete all except X" only lists, doesn't delete

### Issue 3: Context Path Not Used
**Symptom**: Creates files in root instead of selected folder
**Pattern**: AI ignores contextPath even when folder is selected

## 📊 Tool Requirements Summary

### Simple Tools (single parameter)
- read_file: Just needs path
- delete_file: Just needs path
- list_files: Path is optional

### Content Tools (need full content)
- create_file: Needs path + complete content
- edit_file: Needs path + complete content (not diff)
- write_file: Needs file_path + complete content

### Complex Tools (multiple required params)
- move_file: Needs from + to
- DOM tools: Need path + selector + content/updates
- Business tools: Need path + detailed config objects

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Tools Fail:
1. **Streaming Issue**: Tool parameters sent in chunks might not be accumulating
2. **AI Behavior**: Claude might be trying to explain before executing
3. **Parameter Validation**: No pre-check if params exist before sending

### The Critical Flow:
```
User Input → AI Understands → AI Calls Tool → [FAILS HERE] → No Parameters Sent
```

## 📝 What Needs Testing Via AI Chat:

1. **Simple Test**: Ask AI to "read file test-all-tools.md"
   - Should work if path parameter is sent

2. **Create Test**: Ask AI to "create file test.html with hello world"
   - Will fail if parameters aren't sent

3. **Multi-Step Test**: Ask AI to "list files then delete test.html"
   - Will show if multi-step execution works

4. **Context Test**: Select a folder, ask AI to "create index.html"
   - Will show if context is being used

## 🎯 Conclusion

The tools themselves WORK (I've used them successfully). The problem is:
1. **AI isn't sending parameters** with tool calls
2. **AI stops after first tool** in multi-step operations
3. **AI ignores context** even when clearly stated

The issue is in the AI → Tool bridge, not the tools themselves.
